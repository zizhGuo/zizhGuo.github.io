<p>I remembered San Francisco, because I can remember Kim.</p>
<p>I remembered Here Rochester, becasue I can remember my friends, professors and lovely people at RIT.</p>
<p>I can remember becasue of the people I met.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Every piece of my memories makes of me.</p>
<p>The people I've met make me remember at some time, </p>
<p>I was there being with them.</p>
<p>What I want to make is not a cold, </p>
<p>disposable, recreational product. </p>
<p>Instead, </p>
<p>the SOUL.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Game is not just about game.</p>
<p>Game is people.</p>
<p>I remembered Bioshock: Infinite because of Booker and Elizabeth.</p>
<p>I remembered Dishornored becasue of Korvo and Emily.</p>
<p>I remembered Witcher3 becasue of Geralt and Yennefer.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>No man is an island.</p>
