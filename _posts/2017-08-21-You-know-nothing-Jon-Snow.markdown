There's a famous line: You know nothing, Jon Snow. Everytime noticing this line popping up on the screen, we all laugh out loud for Jon's surprising face. However, Jon, do know things. He know exatcly what he want, which is what sometimes people choose to aviod, because what he did takes huge courage and highly potential sacrifice. The hardest thing in the world is not what we normally expect, because there would always be a way for us to achieve it, which only takes how much we can suffer or how much we could offer. The hardest thing, however, is do what we want. It is even difficult to know what we want in the first place. Let alone do it. He never want to be the king, because those "sons of bitches" chose him as the king --- they believe in hime. Jon only do what's meant to be right.

It takes 3 episodes to finally convinced Jon to give himself up for his pride refusing to ben the knee to Mother of Dragons. It takes 7 seasons for audiences to understand how powerful the Night King is. However, it takes 7 years for us to finally know, Jon, no matter how much we love him, is not the perfect ruler of seven kingdoms. Danny has 3 dragons (now is two though), Jon resurrected after being put knife in the heart, let alone the house of Lanister still paying their depts. 

Squad Goals!
