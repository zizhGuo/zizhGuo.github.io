### Python Files
- **run_ML.py**: This files contains the python code to run traditional ML models.
- **run_RNN.py**: This files contains the python code to run the RNN model.

### Library
- TensorFlow Keras

### RNN model 

#### RNN-GRU architecture

#### RNN-Bidirectional LSTM architecture

Figure 2: RNN-BiLSTM


#### Some important details:
- Single Layered RNN-GRU and Bidirectional RNN-LSTM is are the two models that would eventually converge to produce a decent accuracy. However, the other two models – Multi-layered RNN-GRU and Single layered LSTM cannot converge.
- The training/testing observation showed that if the loss for each iteration becomes below 1.0, the model would be quickly converged in the next 2-3 epochs.
- The single layered RNN-GRU is the encoder model of RNN-Encoder Decoder. 
- Word Embedding dimensions: 300
- Hidden States dimensions: 64, 128 (bidirectional RNN-LSTM)
- Max sequence length: 1000 (padded with 0)
