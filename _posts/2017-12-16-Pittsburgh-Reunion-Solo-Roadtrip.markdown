累了，坐在椅子上，唯一不用思考却仍然能大脑中不断循环的场景，是在高速路上开车的场景。这种状态介于极端专注和疲惫之间。就像14号刚到松鼠山的时候，从79号公路进入绕过downtown，进入匹兹堡东部。途中那一次次变道，都比任何一部电影中最惊险的场景还要惊险。我知道，这是不仅仅一次与朋友的会面，就开车而言，都算一次挑战。

I assign myself firstly, during the year I'm in US, being empty. I was driving on the way to Pittsburgh, to see my old friend, who is just graduated from CMU this month. I was in highway thinking no chores but assessing the traffic situation. Sometimes, the memory silencely slided out of my mind. I brooded over them as I did everytime when I was upset, but this was the first time, it popped out when I was happy. 
It goes back to the street I walked on Squireal Hill of Pittsburgh, where a Jewish community locates. I had a strange moment, which is weird but familiar that, the familarity of flevor of Cuicines made me feel like I was actually back to Chengdu, my hometown, at least in a second.
It was a city but town, wherever I walked, there was alwasy parallel parking slot hardly found in Henrietta or Briton. High density of pedestrains made a simple smile happened when people meet on the street deceased. It is normal.
However, I do not hate this feeling. I like being into crowed.
