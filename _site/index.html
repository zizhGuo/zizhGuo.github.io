		<h6 style = "margin:1.5rem"><b>2020.3 - Coronavirus Outbreak</b> - Some thoughts: Some thoughts: Back in Jan, when the virus firstly became epidemic in China, I was physically in Rochester and bombarded by the virus news every single day. Until later when the epidemic gradually under control, I finally got a bit relieved not only because the people I know (my parents, relatives, and friends in Chengdu) were not much influenced by the virus, but also it was hard for the virus affects the US and the local people' lives. It was until after the spring break that RIT determined to shut down the campus and make the classes online that eventually brought me back to the previous feelings that I am now truly physically in the pandemic. Luckily, I am very healthy, and so do my friends, classmates, and professors. Though Rochester is in New York State, the local situation, for now, looks not bad and the local government reacts fast and people actively cooperate with the new policy. Listening to the federal briefing and Governer Cuomo's briefing, I stay home and keep watching over the updated news about the virus. For some moments, I think about the word 'Resilience', since it is the best word I can think which can help people get through a tough time. However, It is also a challenge and a trial for all of us to harden our beliefs. As I have been through the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, where the disaster caused over thirty thousand mortality, experiencing the sad stories by my side during the days, I know what character traits people should own in the bad situation. I believe this pandemic would though take away many beautiful souls and people we love but, as the side effect that we don't want to have in this way, it strengthens the people's minds and makes us stronger so that our soul will never be defeated by the virus. No need to be panic. I am fully confident in the US to win the battle against the pandemic, and myself as well to move on life adapting to the new situation and continue to be working hard.</h6>
